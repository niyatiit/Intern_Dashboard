# 💼 Intern Portal – Round 1 Task

This is a **Full Stack Intern Portal** built for the **Round 1 Task** of the internship process. The goal was to create a basic login/signup UI and a dashboard showing intern details with a referral code and donation stats. This is a **dummy system**, so no real authentication or payment functionality is included.
